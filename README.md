***NOTE: This is not an original idea! I make no claims to the brilliance of this idea. I've only added my own special sauce***

A zero dependency utility to inject a pre commit git hook to add opacity to the body tag of a project and increase it's value using a complex algorithm:

`body.opacity = (now / when) * how pissed i am`

This is especially useful when clients continually hit you with:
  > Your check is on the way

  > I'll have it tommorow

  > I'll have to get back to you

Because it's injected via a pre-commit hook, deleting the injection from the `index.html` will only result in it being re injected on the next commit...

You can find all this out and more by running this simple curl command in the project directory:

`command here`
